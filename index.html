    </ol>

    <h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Interesting DAX syntax was written to calculate columns and metrics:</p>
    <pre>
AGE 2 = DATEDIFF(medallists[birth_date], TODAY(), YEAR)
RANK = RANKX(medals_total, medals_total[Points total])
Points total = medals_total[Gold total] + medals_total[Silver total] + medals_total[Bronze total]
    </pre>
